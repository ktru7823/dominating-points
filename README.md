# dominating-points
Using a divide and conquer algorithm on a set of points to assign a value to each point. This value is based on the number of other points which they 'dominate'. In 2D, each point has (x, y) coordinates. A point P1 = (x1,y1) will dominate another point P2 = (x2,y2) if x1 > x2 AND y1 > y2. This solution is also extended to 3D, where a point has (x,y,z) coordinates.
